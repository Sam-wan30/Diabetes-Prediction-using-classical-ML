# Diabetes-Prediction-using-classical-ML
This project develops and evaluates machine learning models for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. We employ two classical classification algorithms—Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)—to predict diabetes based on patient health metrics.
